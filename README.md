A repository for documentation related to the cooling of shift pods





There is information that is available through various unofficial resources and channels on cooling for the shiftpod (versions 2 and 3), but nothing that is considereed official ; I am providing a document that has what is considered the best information available for cooling a shiftpod within various environments, but mostly with dry desert conditions and for the playa.


This document aims to help you and here's why:


*Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others, not all this time researching cooling for an overpriced tent


*You seek to understand the process of cooling the shiftpod

*You need a centralized resource with references to the best information as it relates to cooling the shiftpod
